#  XOR Encryption (via SHA-256)

Hi! I'm **JL213JL**.  
I created this Python script to encrypt and decrypt any file easily and effectively.

---

##  Overview
This script uses the **XOR** logical operation combined with a **SHA-256** hash of your key to transform your data. The strength lies in the fact that even a short key generates a 32-byte (256-bit) fingerprint for the encryption process.



##  How it works

1. **Input:** Enter the name of the source file (e.g., `photo.jpg`).
2. **Output:** Enter the name of the final file (e.g., `encrypted_photo.dat`).
3. **Key:** Enter your secret password.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **TO DECRYPT:** You must use the **SAME KEY** that was used for encryption. The process is symmetric.
